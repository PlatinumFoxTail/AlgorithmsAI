# Image analysis with Machine learning based on multilayer perceptron artificial neural network

This is a project related to Datastructures and Algorithms Lab course in spring term 2024. The course is part of Computer Science (B.Sc.) studies at University of Helsinki. The intention is to build a multilayer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network from scratch without using ready made MLP models, such as PyTorch and scikit, that will predict the value of the given handwritten digits from MNIST dataset.
