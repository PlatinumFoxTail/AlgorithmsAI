# Week report, week 4

This week was dedicated to set up sanity check of the network including the following:

* Creating a simple network to compare the actual network with
* Align test set up for the both networks
* Benchmarking the networks
* Analyzing test results

Next week I plan to finalize undone things e.g. pylint scores and coverage rate. Also reserving time for the peer-review. No immediate guidance needed at this point.
