# Week report, week 1

During this week the main activity has been to scope the project so that:
* ...the project can work as a springboard for further development of more complex neural networks (such as convolutional neural network) in brain imaging research
* ... the suitability for the Datastructures and Algorithms course

Other activites during the week include familiarizing with the course material, setting-up the GitHub repository, and initiating the documentation.

Next week, I would like to set-up an initial architecture for the MLP to work further on in coming weeks e.g. input-hidden-output layers, activation function. I am struggling a bit to find suitable references on how to initiate the set-up the MLP step-by-step. Would it be possible to provide guidances and material for the aforementioned? I have mostly encountered so far general mathematical descriptions of neural networks and applied MLPs based on different libraries, but not really good suitable reference on how to actually set-up a MLP from scratch in Python.
