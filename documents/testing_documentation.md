# Testing documentation

The testing focus of this project is set on the neural network (network.py), and not other parts such as the user interface (digit_predicter.ipynb). The testing can be divided into two parts: Unit testing & checkstyle and Sanity check. The former is self-explanatory, and the Sanity check includes a comparsion of intermediate outputs from the neural network and a simplified neural network based on simplified MNIST input images.

## Sanity check

* instructions how to repeat

Initial idea/plan as of 2nd of Feb how to perform sanity check:

* Simplify the MNIST input images e.g. to 10pixels
* Set up a simplified network e.g. ready library
* Train the simplified network and own network with the simplified input
* Compare intermediate calculation steps between the simplified network and own network e.g. feedforward outputs.

## Unit testing and checkstyle

Placeholder for...:
* Codecov badge
* pylint

As of 2nd of Feb coverage is 73%. To be finalized when unit tests are finalized.
