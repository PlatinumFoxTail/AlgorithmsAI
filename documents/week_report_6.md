# Week report, week 6

This week peer review task took more time compared to last week, since the reviewed algorithm (DSSP) and project (miinaharava) differed a bit from the neural network that my own project and last week peer review assignment covered. Still it was very learnigful to review other type of projects as well.  

Beside the peer review I was able to finish off some minor undone things e.g. pylint improvement, and unit test. Next week I plan to finalize the project after I have received the second peer revivew feedback.
