## Topic

The topic of the project is a program that predicts handwritten digits based on a multilayer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network. The user can choose handwitten digits from the MNIST dataset to be evaluated by the program. Both the chosen handwritten digits by the user and the program predicted digits will be visible for the the user for comparsion.

The MNIST dataset was chosen as suitable starting point prior to analysis of more complex images. MLP artificial neural network was chosen as a springboard to more advanced neural networks such as convolutional neural networks.

## Programming languages

The program will be based on Python, and the user can run the program via Jupyter Notebook. Supportive libraries, such as Numpy-library for matrix operations, will be used.

Python unittest will be used for unit testing and Codecov for test coverage.

## Algorithm

The main sources for multilayer perceptron artificial network is still to be specified, but a starting point at least:
