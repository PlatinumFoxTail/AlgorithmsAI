# Week report, week 2

During this week the main focus was set to generate an end to end concept for:
* ... loading and preprocessing the MNIST data
* ... building the neural network model
* ... creating a user interface where the user can chose a random digit to be predicted by the neural network model

Quite significant effort was set to create the end to end concept, and hence testing has not been initiated yet.

The following weeks I can not unfortunately use as much time as this week on the project. The next week though, I like to put a bit time to catch up on the testing. In order to save time for setting up the actual required testing and not searching for suitable references for that, I was hoping for some guidance regarding testing. Would it be possible to give some guidance on the testing related questions below?
* How to prioritize the testing order application e.g. i) network.py ii) digit_predicter.ipynb iii) mnist_loader?
* What reference material would be most suitable for the aforementioned python and jupyter files e.g. [this unit testing material](https://github.com/TiraLabra/Testing-and-rmq) seemed to be more related to Java?
* Other testing realted items in prioritization order e.g. codecov badge?
