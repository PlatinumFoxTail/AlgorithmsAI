# Week report, week 5

The time that I had allocated for the course for this week went on doing the peer-review. The peer-review took more time than expected, so own project was not really advanced during the week. This should not however be an issue, since own project requires mostly some minor finalization.

Next week I plan to finalize some minor undone things e.g. improve pylint scores, improve coverage rate, improving based on received peer-review feedback. Also reserving time for the 2nd peer-review. No immediate guidance needed at this point.
